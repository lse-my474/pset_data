# MY474 Applied Machine Learning for Social Science

## Assignment 3

In this second assignment, you will need to fill in a RMarkdown document in the code folder and complete in your writeup in the writeup.

You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom. Remember that we will evaluate you based on your compiled RMarkdown files (in .html format). You can add your responses in italics so that it's easier for us to read them.

This is an group assignment.

Submissions without an html file will receive 0 points.

**Deadline:** 15 March 2023 at 2pm

#### Submitting your assignment

__You do not have to and cannot actively submit your assignment!__

How "submission" works in GitHub classroom:

1. Make changes in your personal assignment repository and push them to GitHub.
2. When the moment the assignment is due, GitHub will take a snapshot of the current state of your personal assignment repository. This snapshot is your submission.
3. Finally, you must submit your compiled html file for your writeup to Moodle.

So all you need to do is to make sure that you:

1. Make your changes before the deadline
2. __Publish your local changes to GitHub before the deadline__
3. __Upload your compiled html file for your writeup to Moodle before the deadline__
